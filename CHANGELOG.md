# TBD
* Switch DockerManager to take in Contexts in its function call, rather than using one struct-global context

# 0.5.0
* Remove return value of `DockerManager.CreateVolume`, which was utterly useless
* Create & tear down a new Docker network per test, to pave the way for parallel tests
* Move FreeIpAddrTracker a little closer to handling IPv6
* Run tests in parallel!
* Print errors directly, rather than rendering them through logrus, to preserve newlines
* Fixed bug where the `TEST RESULTS` section was displaying in nondeterministic order
* Switch to using `nat.Port` object to represent ports to allow for non-TCP ports

# 0.4.0
* remove freeHostPortTracker and all host-container port mappings
* Make tests declare a timeout and mark them as failed if they don't complete in that time
* Explicitly declare which IP will be the gateway IP in managed subnets
* Refactored the big `for` loop inside `TestSuiteRunner.RunTests` into a separate helper function
* Use `defer` to stop the testnet after it's created, so we stop it even in the event of unanticipated panics
* Allow tests to stop network nodes
* Force the user to provide a static service configuration ID when running `ConfigureNetwork` (rather than leaving it autogenerated), so they can reference it later when running their test if they wanted to add a service during the test
* Fix very nasty bug with tests passing when they shouldn't
* Added stacktraces for `TestContext.AssertTrue` by letting the user pass in an `error` that's thrown when the assertion fails

# 0.3.1
* explicitly specify service IDs in network configurations

# 0.3.0
* Stop the node network after the test controller runs
* Rename ServiceFactory(,Config) -> ServiceInitializer(,Core)
* Fix bug with not actually catching panics when running a test
* Fix a bug with the TestController not appropriately catching panics
* Log test result as soon as the test is finished
* Add some extra unit tests
* Implement controller log propagation
* Allow services to declare arbitrary file-based dependencies (necessary for staking)
